- symmetric block cipher
- uses feistal scheme
- 16 round functions
- final permutation (transposition)
- 64 bit block size
- 56 bit key size 	( +8 parity bits)		 [parity bits check if the key has been altered]
- relatively small key size makes it weak


greater complexity is more secure but needs more hardware to process

cannot be secure and fast at the same time


Stream cipher: they process messages one bit/byte at a time
Block cipher   : they prcoess messages in blocks. Block size is based on encryption method


substituion: changing the value of the bit in 1 block
permutation: changing the order of the bits in 1 block
transpotation: see the transpotation pic

		SYMMETRIC BLOCK CIPHERS

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

1. substitution-permutation network

	-provides confusion and diffusion of message and key
		confusion: 
			makes relationship between cipher text and key as complex as possible using substitution

		difussion:
			makes relationship between plain text and cipher text as complex as possible using permutation or transposition




2. feistal scheme
	
	- used in DES
	- see fesital scheme pic
	- a round function is performed each round. No need to know how it really works

	factors of cipher complexity
		~ block size
		~ key size ( why ?)
		~ number of rounds
		~ subkey generation algorithm
		~ round function

	decryption is the same but left and right swap places.
	Use the subkey in reverse order














*****DES

DES uses classical feistel scheme. It has a 64bit block and a [56bit + 8bit parity] 64bit key
See the DES diagram

The 64bit block will be split into 2x 32bit parts. The left and right block.
The left block will go through the first round of encryption. Left block will go through XOR with a function. This function requires 2 parameters. A 48bit subkey and right block. 

The 48bit subkey is generated from the 56bit key using a subkey generation algorithm.

After the left block has gone through XOR with the function, the left block becomes the next round's right block while the initial right block becomes's the next left block.

This process goes through n number of rounds to produce the cipher text

Each round's function works by 






***** AES

AES requires a data block that's in multiples of 16bytes. 16byte, 32byte, or 64byte.
If the data block is 14bytes, then there will be a 2byte padding.
If the data block is 28bytes, then there will be a 8byte padding.





SHA-512 is faster than SHA-1 because it has bigger word size.



pre-image resistant means that 2 plaintexts will never produce the same hash when encrypted

collision resistant also means that same thing but 




must memorise the diffie-Hellman secret key formula ( must know to to do mod )
